## Exercise 1 Color Support 

- Add an integer member fieldmnchannelsand a corresponding pa-
    rameter to the constructor that stores the number of channels per
    pixel. The constructor should only accept the values 1, 3, or 4 for this
    parameter (grayscale, RGB, or RGBA data) and it should terminate
    the program with an error message if a different value is given.
- Write RGB and RGBA versions for thesetandsetrectfunctions
    that takes more channels instead of a single value. Also modify the
    existing version to work with RGB and RGBA images (it should copy
    the givenvalueto RGB channels and assume a default alpha value of
    255).
- Modify the contents of theImage::writepnmfunction so that instead
    of writing an error message for RGB or RGBA images, it saves the
    image contents in the binary PPM format. Hint: You should only
    write the RGB values into the file. The alpha values should not be
    saved. This means you will sometimes need two loops instead of one.

## Exercise 2 Loading PNM Images

Write a new member functionImage::readpnmthat takes astd::string
argument namedfilename. The function should try to open the file with
the given name and read its contents if its contents are in the PGM or
PPM binary formats. When reading color images, remember to create a
four channel RGBA image. You should read the RGB values from the file
and initialize all alpha values to 255.

## Exercise 3 Color Conversion

Write three new member functionsImage::torgb,Image::tograyscale,
andImage::torgba, that converts the image contents from current number
of channels to the desired format. If the image is already of the target format
the functions should return immediately.
To convert from grayscale and RGB to RGBA, just copy the gray or
color value to all the color channels and set alpha to 255. To convert from
RGB and RGBA to grayscale, you can use the following set of formulas:

```
IGray(x, y) =IRed(x, y)∗ 0 .3 +IGreen(x, y)∗ 0 .59 +IBlue(x, y)∗ 0 .11;
```
Before writing back the grayscale value, you should check for underflow and
overflow and you should discard the alpha values.
